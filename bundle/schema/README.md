### Overview

`docs/bundle_descriptions.json` contains both autogenerated as well as manually written
descriptions for the json schema. Specifically
1. `resources` descriptions are autogenerated from the OpenAPI spec
2. All others have been manually added

These descriptions are rendered in the inline documentation in an IDE

### SOP: Add schema descriptions for new fields in bundle config

`bricks bundle docs > ~/bricks/bundle/schema/docs/bundle_descriptions.json`
2. Manually edit bundle_descriptions.json to add descriptions
3. push to repo


### SOP: Update descriptions in resources from a newer openapi spec
